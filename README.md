# even-better-maze-solver

This is a better version of Maze Solver where a priority queue is used instead of a deque to solve a 2D maze. A priority queue 
is an abstract data type for a queue that allows fast access/removal of the minimum element, providing the appearance of a 
sorted queue. Priority queues are an excellent choice for algorithms involving processing a set of choices or possibilities in 
some order based on importance or urgency.

To see a demonstration of how a priority queue is a better algorithm compared to a deque to solve a 2D maze, download or clone 
the project files to a Java IDE, then run the main.java file and enter a maze#.txt file name.
